## 🎯 Matching Rules

✅ **Correct Quantity** - Must have the exact number requested
✅ **In a Line** - Must be in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical)
✅ **Uninterrupted** - All cells in the line must have the same ingredient

### Examples

**✅ VALID MATCH - Order: 🍜x2**
```
[🍜][🍜][🥚][🥩]  ← Select the 2 ramen on the left
```

**✅ VALID MATCH - Order: 🥚x3**
```
Column 2:
[🥚]
[🥚]
[🥚]
[🥩]
```

**❌ INVALID - Wrong Quantity**
```
Order: 🍜x2
[🍜][🍜][🍜][🥚]  ← You selected 3 ramen, but order is x2
```

**❌ INVALID - Not in a Line**
```
Order: 🥩x2
[🥩][🥚]
[🥚][🥩]  ← Ramen not in same row or column
```

## 💡 Tips & Strategies

### For Beginners

1. **Start Simple**
   - Look for **x1 orders** first - easiest to complete
   - These only need 1 of the ingredient

2. **Scan the Grid**
   - Before tapping, look at the whole grid
   - Find the best matches

3. **Check Both Directions**
   - Use the rotate button [⟳]
   - Check horizontal AND vertical lines

4. **Watch for Chains**
   - Sometimes completing one order sets up another
   - The grid refills randomly, creating new opportunities

### For Advanced Players

1. **Plan Ahead**
   - Look at all 4 orders
   - Prioritize harder orders (x3) when you see opportunities

2. **Look for 4-in-a-Row**
   - Even if no order matches, 4-in-a-row might appear
   - These automatically clear and give you stars ⭐

3. **Corner Strategy**
   - Corners and edges can be easier to track
   - Fewer directions to check

4. **Order Priority**
   - Complete **x3 orders** when possible (harder to find)
   - Save **x1 orders** for when you're stuck (always available)
