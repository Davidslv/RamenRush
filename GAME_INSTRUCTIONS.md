# 🍜 Ramen Rush - Game Instructions

## 🎯 How to Play

### 📋 Understanding Orders

**The cards at the bottom of the screen show what our customers want.**

Each order card displays:
- A food emoji (🍜 🥚 🥩 🥬)
- A quantity: **x1**, **x2**, or **x3**

---

## 🎮 Making Matches

### Finding Lines

**We have to find a line of food on the board (grid) that matches one of the cards.**

The game board is a **4×4 grid** filled with different foods. Your goal is to select lines that match the customer orders.

### Selecting Lines

**We can select vertical or horizontal lines.**

- **Horizontal** = Left to right (row)
- **Vertical** = Top to bottom (column)

💡 *Use the rotate button (⟳) to switch between horizontal and vertical selection!*

### Line Requirements

**But it needs to be an uninterrupted line of the same food.**

✅ Valid line: 🍜 🍜 🍜 (3 ramen in a row)
❌ Invalid line: 🍜 🥚 🍜 (interrupted by egg)

### Matching Orders

**We can only serve lines of food that perfectly match the cards.**

- If order says **🍜x2**, you need exactly **2 ramen** in your line
- If order says **🥚x3**, you need exactly **3 eggs** in your line
- The food type AND quantity must match!

## 💡 Difficulty Levels

### Easy Orders - x1

**Sometimes it will be easy - like with the x1 cards.**

- **x1 orders** need only 1 of that food
- These are the easiest to complete
- Great for when you're stuck!

### Hard Orders - x3

**Sometimes it can get really hard - with troublesome x3 orders.**

- **x3 orders** need 3 of the same food in a line
- Much harder to find on the board
- Complete these when you spot an opportunity!

## ⭐ Special Powers

### The Magical Box

**But if we get stuck, we can look into the magical box to activate special powers.**

Located in the top-left corner, the magical ★-box contains special abilities to help you when you're in trouble.

### Power Costs

**The powers cost 1 point.**

Each special power requires **1 star** (★) to activate. Use them wisely!

### Earning Stars

**We can gain more points by aligning 4 of the same food in a row or column (horizontally or vertically).**

- Match **4 identical foods** in a line
- Works horizontally (left-right) or vertically (top-bottom)
- Automatically earns you **1 star** (★)
- Stars let you use special powers!

💡 *Look for opportunities to create 4-in-a-row matches to build up your stars!*
